Hello, my name is Richard. 
I am currently studying web development and learning English is very important for this career.
If you want to work in this field, you need to speak English very fluently.
Therefore, my primary goal is to pass the B1 exam, which is the reason I have just mentioned.

I have organized my monologue into four parts:
My favourite dish, my eating habits, diet-related problems, and healthy food versus fast food.

I am going to start by talking about my favourite dish. My favourite dish is a typical Valencian dish called paella. This dish is made with rice, chicken, rabbit, vegetables, and saffron.

About my eating habits I can say that I usually eat so well, so healthy. 
I try to avoid fast food as much as possible, but I have an addiction to sugar. I can't resist it.

Regarding diet-related problems, I have to say that I have never had any problems with my diet. 
The unique thing that I have is that I am a little overweight. I think I should lose some weight.

Finally, I am going to talk about the difference between healthy food and fast food. I can't say anything you don't know.
Healthy food is much better than fast food.
Everybody should eat healthy food to have a healthy life.
To conclude, Iâ€™ll just say that healthy food is very boring. So, die fat but very happy!
